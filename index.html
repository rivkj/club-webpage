          <p>Join our virtual <strong>Good Reads Mouse Club</strong> and find new books to read and discuss. <strong>How it works:</strong><br>We go through the Top Books on Good Reads and you pick the book you want to read for the next month by sending us your choice at <email>info@littlemousebooks.com</email>. Find a book you hated and want others to suffer with you? Let us know. Find the next big thing? We want to read it too! Want someone to keep you accountable on your reading? We're on it.
          </p>
          <p>On the 12th of every month, all members receive an email with the next book to read for the following month. We'll meet through Zoom and discuss the book from the comfort of your home. Any questions or concerns can be directed to our email or drop in and let one of the staff know.</p>
